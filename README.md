# Workshop-NeuralODE-2020
A 45 minute showcase on the how and the why of neural differential equations. 

## Installation

## Content
There are three julia notebooks that show,

1. an introduction to machine learning and neural networks,
2. learning reaction kinetics using neural differential equations (NODEs),
3. coupling these NODEs with reactor models.
