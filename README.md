# Workshop-NeuralODE-2020
A 45 minute showcase on the how and the why of neural differential equations. 

## Installation

## Content
There are three julia notebooks that show,

1. an introduction to machine learning and neural networks,

2. learning reaction kinetics using neural differential equations (NODEs),

[reaction rates](./figs/reactionRate.png)

3. coupling these NODEs with reactor models.
